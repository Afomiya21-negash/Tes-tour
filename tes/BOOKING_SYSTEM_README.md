# Booking System Implementation

## Overview

I've implemented a complete booking system for your tour application with the following features:

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

1. **Database Schema** - Already existed with proper relationships
2. **API Endpoints** - Complete REST API for tours, vehicles, bookings, and payments
3. **Frontend Components** - Enhanced BookingPopup with real data integration
4. **Customer Dashboard** - View bookings, payment status, and booking history
5. **Domain Logic** - Comprehensive business logic for booking operations

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend (API Routes)

- **Tours API** (`/api/tours`)
  - `GET /api/tours` - List all available tours
  - `GET /api/tours/[id]` - Get specific tour details

- **Vehicles API** (`/api/vehicles`)
  - `GET /api/vehicles` - List all available vehicles
  - `GET /api/vehicles/[id]` - Get specific vehicle details

- **Bookings API** (`/api/bookings`)
  - `POST /api/bookings` - Create new booking (requires customer auth)
  - `GET /api/bookings` - Get user's bookings (requires customer auth)
  - `GET /api/bookings/[id]` - Get specific booking details

- **Payments API** (`/api/payments`)
  - `POST /api/payments` - Process payment for booking
  - `GET /api/payments/booking/[bookingId]` - Get payment details

### Frontend Components

- **BookingPopup** (`/components/BookingPopup.tsx`)
  - 4-step booking process
  - Real-time data fetching from APIs
  - Form validation and error handling
  - Payment processing integration

- **Customer Dashboard** (`/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
  - View all bookings
  - Booking status tracking
  - Payment status display
  - Statistics overview

### Domain Services

- **PaymentService** - Handles payment processing

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

```

### 2. Test the API

```bash
# Test the API endpoints
node scripts/test-booking-api.js
```
